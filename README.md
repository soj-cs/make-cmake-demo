## Combination of Makefile and CMakeLists.txt

This example is useful when e.g. Eclipse require *Existing project with Makefile*, 
but `CMakeLists.txt` is available.

## How-to

Download this project and in directory with `Makefile` use command `make` to compile program `main.cpp`.
This program will be compiled in directory `build` using `cmake` and executable file `main` will be placed into directory with source code`main.cpp`.
